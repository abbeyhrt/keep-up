## Up & Running

`keep-up` requires the following tools and technologies for local development:

* Golang, can use Homebrew for installation
* [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/docker-for-mac/install/) for local development

### Local Database setup

Before running the server, youâ€™ll need to make sure to start up the local
database defined in `docker-compose.yml`. You can do this by running:

```bash
# Run the database in detached mode
docker-compose run -d postgres
```

You can verify that postgres is up by running `docker ps` and seeing the
postgres container in the displayed list.

Most likely, you'll also need to run migrations as well to make sure that your
local copy of the database matches the latest version for keep-up. You can find
more details about how we do migrations [here](./docs/migrations.md).

### Starting the server

You can start the server locally by running:

```bash
# Source your local `.env` file
source .env
go run ./graphql/cmd/pubapid/main.go
```

If you want to just run the server while working on the UI, you can just use
`docker-compose` by doing:

```bash
docker-compose up -d
```

### Local `.env` file

We require a couple ENV variables in order to properly run the server. You can
start off by copying `.env.template` to `.env`. For secrets, reach out to a team
member in order to get the exact values. An important note, make sure not to
commit the `.env` file!
